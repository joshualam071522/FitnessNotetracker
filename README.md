## Description

The purpose of this project was to build an application that helps track your workout and meal plans in order to reach the user's fitness goals and achieve their highest state of health. This is a full-stack application, as it contains both frontend and backend properties. Its main technologies include express, sequelize, mysql, handlebars, dotevnv, and bycrypt. The general layout of the repository is in a Model-View-Controller structure.

In order to install this application, the user would have to clone the repository. From there, they would use the command "npm install" to install all the relevant packages.

## Usage

To use the application, one must simply start the server by typing in the command terminal "npm start". From there, they will can reach the base website by address: localhost:3001. From there, they will see the homepage with links to the navbar that say login and signup. The user must create an account and sign in before accessing their meal and workout plans. After the user has successfully logged in, the navbar on the homepage will change to My Workouts, My Meals, and Logout. From there, the user can go to either my workouts or meals. there will be a form to fill out in either page, with field such as Title, Content, and either calories if you are in the meal page and time worked out in the workout page. After pressing the create button when you have filled out the 3 fields, the page will refresh and show you your new workout or meal! There will also be a red delete button for each one incase you dont need it anymore. And you can add as much meals/workouts as you want!
